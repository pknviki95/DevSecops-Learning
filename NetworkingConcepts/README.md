Workflow of Client-server Architecture:
---------------------------------------

- The user devices can be a computer or a mobile device with an application installed. 
- The user also calls the Client sends a request to the host server anticipating a response and is disconnected from the network after completing the request. 
- The Client's bandwidth ability will determine the speed of delivery.

*For Example:*

- when you type www.google.com into your web browser, **your browser is acting as a client**. 
- It makes a **request** to Google’s servers for the website you’ve requested. 
- Google’s servers then fulfill that request by **sending back response** the HTML code for the Google home page. 
- Your browser then renders that HTML code into the familiar page of text, images, and links we all know so well.

**(i.e) client sends request to server and server sends reponse to respective request back to client**
