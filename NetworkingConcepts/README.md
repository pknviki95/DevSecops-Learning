Computer Networks Concepts:
---------------------------

Terminology:
------------

- Networking
- Client
- Server
- Client-server architecture
- Protocols
- Packets
- IP-Address

Networking:
-----------
- Networking is the act of making communication and data exchange between different communities and organizations

Client:
-------
- A client is a program that makes requests to a server

Server:
-------
- A server is a program that fulfills those requests

client-server Architecture:
---------------------------

Workflow of Client-server Architecture:
---------------------------------------

- The user devices can be a computer or a mobile device with an application installed. 
- The user also calls the Client sends a request to the host server anticipating a response and is disconnected from the network after completing the request. 
- The Client's bandwidth ability will determine the speed of delivery.

*For Example:*

- when you type www.google.com into your web browser, **your browser is acting as a client**. 
- It makes a **request** to Google’s servers for the website you’ve requested. 
- Google’s servers then fulfill that request by **sending back response** the HTML code for the Google home page. 
- Your browser then renders that HTML code into the familiar page of text, images, and links we all know so well.

**(i.e) client sends request to server and server sends reponse to respective request back to client**

Protocols:
-----------
- A protocol is a **set of rules and guidelines for communicating data**. 
- Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers. 
- Networks have to follow these rules to successfully transmit data.
- It is determined/Developed by Internet community
- TCP,UDP,HTTP,HTTPS,FTP are some of protocols

How Data is Transferred?
------------------------
- The data thatis communicated between client and server is through something called **Packets**.

Packets:
--------
- A packet is a **small segment of a larger message**. 
- Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. 
- These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.

IP-address:
------------
- ‘IP’ stands for Internet Protocol, which is the set of rules that makes it possible for devices to communicate over the **Internet**. 
- With billions of people accessing the Internet every day, unique identifiers are necessary to keep track of who is doing what. 
- The Internet Protocol solves this by **assigning IP numbers to every device accessing the Internet**.

**(i.e) IP- Address is similar to people living address Internet Protocol assigns IP numbers for all the individual device you use for accessing the internet**

Various Types of IP-Address:
-----------------------------
- Public
- Private
- Static
- Dynamic
