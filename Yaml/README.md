What is YAML language?
-----------------------

- Yaml stands for **YAML Ain't Markup Language**
- It is a **Data serialization language** like JSON,XML etc.,
- It is a simple text-based ,Human-readable language used to exchange data between human and computer.
- It works perfectly with Python.Go,Ruby etc., (Serialization and de-serialization of data using these languages is possible)
- It is mainly used as **configuration files for the program to process the data** (Most programming languages support YAMLlibraries)
- YAML also supports all datatypes like **Arrays,Dictionaries,Set** etc.,
- Extension is **.yaml** or **.yml**

Data Serialization/De-Serialization:
--------------------------------------

- **Data serialization** is a process of converting a data to format that can be easily stored (and recovered) or sent over the network.
- It is the process of converting data objects present in complex data structures into a **byte stream** for storage, transfer and distribution purposes on physical devices.
- **Data De-Serialization** is a process of coverting back to **data objects** from byte stream shared via Serialization process (i.e) vice-versa of Serialization.
- It can be achieved by processing the **Data serialization language** like JSON,XML etc., through various programming language.
