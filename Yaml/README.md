### YAML language:

- Yaml stands for ```YAML Ain't Markup Language```
- It is a ```Data serialization language``` like JSON,XML etc.,
- It is a simple text-based ,Human-readable language used to exchange data between human and computer.
- It works perfectly with Python.Go,Ruby etc., (Serialization and de-serialization of data using these languages is possible)
- It is mainly used as configuration files for the program to process the data (Most programming languages support YAMLlibraries)
- YAML also supports all datatypes like ```Arrays```,```Dictionaries```,```Set``` etc.,
- Extension is ```.yaml``` or ```.yml```

### Data Serialization/De-Serialization:

#### Data serialization:

- Data serialization is a process of converting a data to format that can be easily stored (and recovered) or sent over the network.
- It is the process of converting data objects present in complex data structures into a ```byte stream``` for storage, transfer and distribution purposes on physical devices.
#### Data De-Serialization:
- Data De-Serialization is a process of converting back to ```data objects``` from byte stream shared via Serialization process (i.e) vice-versa of Serialization.
- It can be achieved by processing the Data serialization language like JSON,XML etc., through various programming language.
